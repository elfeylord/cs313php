The purpose of this assignment is to review a minimal level of client-side programming and provide a homepage from which you can link to future assignments.

GUIDELINES
The following guidelines are a minimum standard for this assignment (required for a 93%). To earn a 100% on the assignment, you will need to go above and beyond this standard to show your creativity and ingenuity.

Minimum Standards:

Something dynamic (e.g., mouse-overs, menus, on-click, on-change, etc.)
Include reasonable colors, images, etc. to show your creativity and personality (but don’t forget to keep it somewhat professional).
As always, you are strongly encouraged to go above and beyond these guidelines.

After completing these steps, please update the Student Wiki to point to your new homepage (if the URL is different than your “Hello World” page). 

Finally, complete the questions in this assessment.
